# rescue-sim — Telecom Disaster Extension for RoboCup Rescue Simulation

Telecom disaster scenarios for the [RoboCup Rescue Simulation (RCRS)]
server: cell-site (BTS) infrastructure, hurricane-calibrated damage
models, and — the defining feature — **agent communications routed
through the cellular network: when BTSs die, comms die for uncovered
agents and civilians.**

Public artifact for the papers portfolio (papers 3/4: rescue coordination
and AI-native telecom OSS). Sibling consumer: `telecom-oss` (AI-native
OSS speaking TMF Open APIs, drives restoration work orders back into the
sim at v1.1).

## Status

**v1.0 released (tag `v1.0`).** Telecom disaster module implemented
(`modules/telecom`, 41 unit tests green, headless closed-loop verified):
BTS entities, radial coverage v0, Maria/Sandy-calibrated damage model,
BTS-gated communication model, restoration brigade (COW/repair/refuel)
with the rule-based classical policy, population-coverage scoring, and a
plain-JSON REST telemetry/work-order endpoint. v1.1 reshapes the REST
contract to TMF Open APIs. **Design decisions are locked in
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) — read it before contributing.**

## Relationship to upstream

This is a copy of [roborescue/rcrs-server](https://github.com/roborescue/rcrs-server)
(BSD-3-Clause) at upstream HEAD (root commit `9deec95`), extended by the
`modules/telecom` module. It is **not** a GitHub fork of upstream (no
shared git ancestry): upstream changes are merged by tree-diff porting.
All upstream code is untouched except `build.gradle` (wired the telecom
source dir + jar tasks, mirroring how every other module is wired).

**Extension rules** (see DECISIONS.md): telecom code lives only in
`modules/telecom`; `modules/standard`, `modules/kernel`,
`modules/rescuecore2` are never edited in place; classic scenarios
without telecom config keys behave identically to upstream.

## What the telecom module adds

1. **BTS entities** (cell sites): position, coverage radius, operational
   state (operational / damaged / destroyed), power mode (grid /
   generator / none) with generator fuel hours, backhaul (fiber /
   microwave / satellite / none). BTSs serve coverage iff operational
   AND powered AND backhaul live. BTSs live module-side (own URN space,
   `urn:rescuecore2.telecom:*`, ids 0x2100/0x2200) — deliberately not in
   the standard RCRS world model, which keeps `modules/standard`
   untouched (DECISIONS.md ADR-001).
2. **Disaster damage model** calibrated to public data
   (papers/paper4-telecom-oss/grounding-facts.md): Hurricane Maria 2017 —
   95% of PR's cell network down day 1 (mix: ~25% tower collapse, ~60%
   backhaul cuts, ~15% grid power loss); Hurricane Sandy 2012 — ~25%
   out, power-dominated. Generators run on a fuel countdown (Maria:
   fuel logistics was the binding constraint).
3. **BTS-gated comms**: a drop-in communication model that delegates to
   the standard channel model, then filters what each agent hears by
   BTS coverage. Uncovered agents — and uncovered civilians — hear
   nothing. This is the coverage-aware-civilian effect: people outside
   coverage cannot call for help.
4. **Telecom Restoration Brigade** (roadmap T4): COW/COLT deployment,
   repairs, refuelling, driven by a pluggable restoration policy; the
   rule-based policy mirrors what Maria/Sandy/9-11 operators actually
   did (government/911 sites first, dense population second, remote
   last) and serves as the classical baseline for agent-based (LLM)
   policies.
5. **Coverage scoring** (roadmap T5): population-covered-% (FCC DIR
   style) as an RCRS score component.
6. **Telemetry / work-order endpoint** (roadmap T6): plain REST out of
   the sim, work orders in — TMF Open API shaped at v1.1.

## Quick start

Requires Java 21 and the Gradle wrapper (first run downloads ~130MB).

```bash
./gradlew completeBuild          # builds all module jars into jars/ + libs into lib/
./gradlew test                   # telecom module unit tests

# Headless telecom scenario on the test map (300 timesteps, Maria curve)
CP="$(printf '%s:' jars/*.jar)$(printf '%s:' lib/*.jar)"
java -Xmx512m -Dlog4j.log.dir=/tmp/telecom \
  -cp "$CP" kernel.StartKernel \
  -c maps/test/config/kernel-telecom.cfg \
  --gis.map.dir=maps/test/map \
  --kernel.logname=/tmp/telecom/rescue.log.7z \
  --loadabletypes.inspect.dir=jars \
  --nogui --nomenu --autorun
```

Watch the log for `TelecomSimulator connected: N BTSs` and
`applied initial damage`. Without `--loadabletypes.inspect.dir=jars`
and with the wrong map dir the kernel will fail to find GIS/jars — those
flags matter when launching from the repo root (upstream `start.sh`
assumes cwd `scripts/`).

Classic upstream scenarios run unchanged: `bash scripts/start.sh -m
maps/test/map -c maps/test/config -g` (see `scripts/functions.sh`).

## Telecom config keys (opt-in)

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kernel.simulators.auto +: telecom.TelecomSimulator` | activates the telecom sim (BTS load + damage) |
| `kernel.communication: telecom.comms.TelecomCommunicationModel` | BTS-gated comms (delegates channel model) |
| `score.function: telecom.score.TelecomScoreFunction` | RSL21 + population-coverage% composite scoring |
| `telecom.bts.list: x,y,radius;...` | explicit BTS placement (takes precedence) |
| `telecom.bts.grid: cols,rows,dx,dy,x0,y0,radius` | seeded grid placement |
| `telecom.damage.scenario: maria\|sandy\|none` | day-1 damage curve |
| `telecom.damage.steps-per-day: N` | kernel steps per simulated day (1440 = 1-min steps) |
| `telecom.damage.generator-hours: H` | generator fuel tank (hours) |
| `telecom.comms.bts-required: true\|false` | hearing requires BTS coverage (false = passthrough) |
| `telecom.policy.enabled: true\|false` | rule-based restoration policy (default off; external orders otherwise) |
| `telecom.policy.max-orders-per-tick: N` | planning bound per tick |
| `telecom.brigade.cow-stock: N` | COW inventory |
| `telecom.brigade.cow-setup-steps: N` | COW deployment time (default 1440 ≈ 1 day) |
| `telecom.brigade.repair-steps: N` | repair time (default 4320 ≈ 3 days) |
| `telecom.brigade.refuel-steps: N` | refuel time (default 720 ≈ 12 h) |
| `telecom.brigade.refuel-hours: H` | tank refill amount (default 72 h) |
| `telecom.http.port: P` | REST telemetry port (0 = off, default); `GET /telecom/sites\|coverage\|alarms`, `POST /telecom/workorders` |

See `maps/test/config/kernel-telecom.cfg` for a working example.

## Roadmap
